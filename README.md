###
An android developer and a competitive programmer. I am a 3 star coder at Codechef and have gained gold medals in cpp and problem solving on Hackerrank. I love learning new concepts and exploring everything related to computer science.
I'm a person who believes in hard work and doesn't leave anything to chance. I'm an ardent follower of Elon Musk, specially because of his creative ideas. I set short and long term goals that allow me to meet deadlines easily and also save valuable time.
